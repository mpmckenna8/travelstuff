// component for editing item because trying to do js manipulation on the component was getting messy

import React from "react"

// also need to pass a function which will dispatch an update of the item in state
const EditItem = ({currentItem}) = {

  return (
    <div>
      edit item stuff to go here
    </div>
  )
}
